`Description`:
A collection of implementations of classic Direction of Arrival (DOA) algorithms, widely used in array signal processing and sensor array applications. This repository provides a comprehensive library of DOA algorithms, including:

Beamforming: Delay-and-Sum, MVDR (Minimum Variance Distortionless Response), and others
Subspace-based methods: MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification), ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques)
Propagator-based methods: Propagator Method
Other classic DOA algorithms: Bartlett, Capon, and more
Note: This is an ongoing project, and more algorithms will be added in the future. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

`Purpose`:
The goal of this repository is to provide a centralized location for researchers, students, and practitioners to access and compare the implementations of various classic DOA algorithms. The code is intended to be educational, reusable, and easily modifiable for specific use cases.

`Structure`:
The repository will be organized into folders, each corresponding to a specific DOA algorithm or category of algorithms. Each folder will contain:

A brief description of the algorithm
A Python implementation of the algorithm
Example usage and simulation scripts
References and relevant literature

`Contributions`:
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add a new algorithm, improve an existing implementation, or provide a use case, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
Feel free to modify this description to best suit your needs!
